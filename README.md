## Introduction
go-linode is a WIP Golang library for working with the Linode API. The goals for the project is as follows:

* Full API coverage of the Linode API (including the all important test.echo)
* Provide both a lean interface and an OOP friendly interface for both tastes
* Generated objects (Plans, Data Centers, etc) from API data to make code completion easy for infrequent changing things
* Support the batch API

This library is still under development and aggressive refactoring. No promises are made regarding the stability of the interface yet, but soon...
